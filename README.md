# Virtual Desktop
This version of Virtual Desktop unlocks the ability to stream SteamVR games from your computer to your Oculus Go or Oculus Quest headset over Wi-Fi or from anywhere around the world. It supports Bluetooth mice, keyboards and gamepads. It features glitch-free low latency streaming, microphone passthrough, gamepad emulation and much more. You need to purchase the app in the Oculus Store for the app to work. Once sideloaded, the app will appear in the Apps tab instead of Unknown Sources.
